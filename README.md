# URL Shortener

Simple and minimalism URL Shortener

## Made out of

- XORM as ORM
- Echo as HTTP Framework
- Vue3 with Ant Design Vue (Soon) for frontend
- go-playground/validator as Validator
- Cobra as cli and configuration manager

## Running project

just run project with `--help` to see options and their env equivalent

### Locally

**Unix Users Only** use run script, it will install dependencies, format the code and run the project

### Docker

Dockerfile for the project is available here, I will make pre-built Docker images available later on using GitHub Action and ghcr

## TODO

- [  ] Add more deploy/build options
- [  ] API Documentation (swaggo is buggy and generating errors with some datatypes)
- [  ] Vue3 Frontend
- [  ] Webhook and Reporting Support
